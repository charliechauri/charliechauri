Hi! I'm a Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience across multiple industries (travel technology, human resources, legal services and energy) within remote teams and global projects.

I have contributed in topics such as: frontend development, a11y compliance, backend development, software architecture, test automation, infrastructure design, workflow automation, tech stack migrations and optimizations for highly trafficked distributed systems in agile environments.

I considered myself a passionated learner seeking to improve my skills and develop relevant software solutions. Focused on writing clean and scalable code.

Currently helping people to travel safely around the world and contributing to deconstruct the legitimacy of the meritocracy
